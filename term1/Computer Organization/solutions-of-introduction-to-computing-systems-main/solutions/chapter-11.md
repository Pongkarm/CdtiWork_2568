# Chapter 11

1. Remembering and following which value in which register and at what point they changed, it was very though one.
---
2. They take boring chores stuff from our responsibility like I mentioned first answer, so we can write programs faster and can be more productive. Also, they generally make maintain and debug the software easier. So we can fix and develop programs more easily.
---
3. When we confront about an important decision, our options may be limited due to wall of abstracting behind of us.
---
4. Compiled binary is simply a machine code or a code that seriously close to machine code so, it can run at a full speed. On the other hand interpreter converts user program block-by-block(subroutines) or line-by-line to machine code at the runtime. Therefore, it always have to deals with this overhead before executing machine code.
---
5. Compilation process convert user program to a specific machine's ISA's. So, it may require extra effort and development for compiler work with every possible ISAs. But in the other hand if an interpreter can run on a that ISA as a user program, it can run every program use that interpreter.
---
6. Because command line interface doesn't convert a high level language to machine code, it just interpret and run input that given to itself.
---
7. It is interpreter. It doesn't convert to LC-3 machine code, but rather it runs LC-3 user programs in different ISAs.

9. Solution:
   1. The preprocessor receives C source and header files: It is all source code written by programmers.
   2. The compiler receives preprocessed source code: All preprocessor macros expanded and all included files added to required places.
   3. The linker receives object module(s): All object modules that reference each other (with subroutines) and external labels (libraries) will resolve by the linker.
---
10. Solution:
    1. It prints alphabet character with descending order.
    2. It prints counter and sum of counter and start point together.
    3. It prints corresponding ASCII hex code of decimal value with descending order.
---
11. It read a character and prints a decimal value. It display ASCII value of character.
---
12. Solution:
    1. a
    2. x3000
    3. $123.10 n
---
13. It gets input with `scanf("%d", num)` and print with `printf("%x", num)`
